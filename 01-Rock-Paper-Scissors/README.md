# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors (C++)

This is my **first C++ project**, built while learning programming fundamentals.
It is a console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game where the player competes against the computer.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Enums
- Structs
- Functions
- Switch statements
- Control flow
- Random number generation
- Clean and organized code structure

---

## 🕹 Game Rules
- The player chooses:
  - 1 → Stone
  - 2 → Paper
  - 3 → Scissors
- The computer makes a random choice
- The game is played for **3 rounds**
- The final winner is displayed at the end

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile the program:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o game


## 🧩 Example Output
./game

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to use enums and structs to organize data
- Separating logic into reusable functions
- Writing clean and readable C++ code
- Implementing game logic step by step

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Allow the player to choose the number of rounds
- Add score history
- Improve the UI with colors
- Convert the project to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
